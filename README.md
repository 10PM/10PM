## FAQ
   ### What's some basic info about you?
 - I have a multitude of names I'm okay with. **_Vin_**, **Kaz**, or **any of my current aliases** are fine.
     - This isn't something I like to clarify, but my pronouns are **he/him**. If this is hard to remember, I'm okay with pretty much anything as long as it's not they/them or any similar neo/xeno variant. Please remember not to refer to me as such.


 - I am Filipino.
     - ENG/TAG OK. I'm more of a speaker than a typer, so I sadly cannot text back in anything but English.

 - I'm very childish in nature. Please excuse my immaturity, I'm trying to work on it.
 - I have an auditory processing disorder, so in the case of places that have voice chats, you may have to repeat yourself a few times if I ask.

I'm really not the best at creating bios since I'm not great at remembering my ever so changing self. T_T
### What do you enjoy?
 - My current 'fandom' interest is **Genshin Impact**.
     - America, AR52. Feel free to ask for my UID if we interact.
- I also enjoy many other pieces of content, such as Nintendo games, `especially the MOTHER/Earthbound series` Your Turn to Die, Puyo Puyo, OMORI, Cookie Run, Gantz, and a few unlisted series that I'm too embarrassed to disclose.
- I'm... kind of addicted to VRChat... To the point where I have full body tracking.
     - If you're here from PT and want me to do some funny stuff with your favorite character in that game, by all means approach me about it! I love entertaining people. You don't have to have a VR headset, you can just download the game on Steam and play it as is.

This is all for now. I'll add more later.
