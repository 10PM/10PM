## Want to know some info about me?
### ☆ I have a multitude of names but I'd prefer to be called Vince atm
#### im not good at making bios so its just like this for now lol
- I'm 20, and a dude

   - pronouns that **aren't they/them** are ok with me though

- I have mental issues [don't we all?] so it might take me a bit to process things but I'll do my best!

- I'm off-tab most of the time, if you need to say something feel free to whisper it.

- Due to paranoia, I freely hide, but I'm slowly learning to get over this ^^;

## Interests

- I'm super into Splatoon right now. I am in a comp team but for the safety of the other members I cannot speak of the details.

       You may have noticed that my profile has Genshin images, but I don't really associate myself with the fandom nor do I play the game anymore.

- I also really like a handful of games from Nintendo, mostly the MOTHER/Earthbound series.  ♡
- I very much enjoy visual novels, RPGs, and VR games/applications.

       Feel free to ask me more about VR. I love this topic and would like to help or learn from other people!

## DNI List [long but optional to read]
### This is not definitive, but you're more likely to get hidden if you fit the category.

- Close-minded people to the point of extremity
  - This is not limited to debates. Please don't get so heated, emotions WILL cloud most people's logic.

- You value the safety/morals of fictional characters over real people's trauma [☆](https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Three_Laws_of_Fandom)

- **You automatically believe that other people's opinions = strongly opposing/supporting the other side**

   - So many of you people need to realize that not everything is black and white when it comes to that.
 
- You consistently **directly** fuck people up, physically and/or mentally

   - Also, unless they have gone after you personally, being uncomfortable with someone is not direct. Hide them for your safety.

- Excessive use of tone tags

   - I'm okay with tone tags if they're needed. Just... Please don't use them in every sentence. It feels like a weird filter. 

- You believe making skins = part of a fandom
   - There are exceptions to this like making something from extremely problematic media (Harry Potter, for example) but most of the time I might not even know about the series my ponies are from LMAO

[Thank you for reading.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjlkBkfLzC8)

For those who don't know what this bio is for, it's for [this place.](https://pony.town/)

And for those who say that github is for coders, I do have a proper account showcasing my spaghetti ass C++ stuff but I don't want to share a pony town bio with it. It's embarrassing on both ends lol

I really do not suggest getting into pony.town if you don't know what it is. It's a shit fest.
