## FAQ
   ### What's some basic info about you?
 - I have a multitude of names I'm okay with. **_Vin_**, **Kaz**, or **any of my current aliases** are fine.
     - My name was Kaz MONTHS before Kazuha came out. Please don't attack me for my name.
 - I'm a dude. I don't really care what you call me though as long as you don't emphasize it.
 - I'm very childish in nature. Please excuse my immaturity, I'm trying to work on it.
 - I have an auditory processing disorder, so in the case of places that have voice chats, you may have to repeat yourself a few times if I ask.

I'm really not the best at creating bios since I'm not great at remembering my ever so changing self. T_T

### What do you enjoy?
 - My current 'fandom' interest is **Genshin Impact**.
     - America, AR53. Feel free to ask for my UID if we interact.
- I also enjoy many other pieces of content, such as Nintendo games, `especially the MOTHER/Earthbound series` Your Turn to Die, Puyo Puyo, OMORI, Gantz, and a few unlisted series that I'm too embarrassed to disclose.
- I'm... kind of addicted to VRChat... I would rather be playing that over PT, where most of you come from.
     -  If you play it as well, let's play together. ^_^ Communication through VRC feels a bit better than being on PT.
### Is there anything I should avoid around you?
 - The general thing most people dislike. AKA any logical DNI criteria such as racism or homophobia.
 - **PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP SENDING HATE TO ME.** 
     - I have a really bad history of PT stalkers, I'm very hide-heavy because of this. Don't take it to heart if I hide you.
 - If you ship Kaeluc/Luckae **as incest**, you're fucking weird.
     - I understand the Sworn Brothers sentiment and I won't attack you for it but if you ship them with incestual undertones, that's inexcusable.
 - Don't harass people for being doubles of you. Just hide them.
     - There will always be multiple versions of you in a world of media. I had to learn this, so should you.
### Anything else you want to say?
- You guys should really try github for your bios, it's pretty swag.
