## Want to know some info about me?
### ☆ I have a multitude of names but I'd prefer to be called Vince atm
#### im not good at making bios so its just like this for now lol
- I'm 19, and a dude
   - pronouns that **aren't they/them** are ok with me though

- I'm off-tab most of the time, if you need to say something feel free to whisper it.
- Due to paranoia, I freely hide, but I'm slowly learning to get over this ^^;

## Interests

- Genshin Impact is my current hyperfixation at the moment

       I'm a bit burnt out from it due to a mixture of things, but if you want to play, you can ask for my UID.

- I also really like a handful of games from Nintendo, mostly the MOTHER/Earthbound series.  ♡
- I'm most likely chilling in **VRChat** since I have a full-body setup and want to make use of it.

       Feel free to ask me more about VR. I love this topic and would like to help or learn from other people!

## DNI List
### This is not definitive, but you're more likely to get hidden if you fit the category.

- Close-minded people to the point of extremity
  - This is not limited to debates. Please don't get so heated, emotions WILL cloud most people's logic.

- You value the safety/morals of fictional characters over real people's trauma [☆](https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Three_Laws_of_Fandom)

- You automatically believe that other people's opinions = strongly opposing/supporting the other side

   - So many of you people need to realize that not everything is black and white when it comes to that.
 
- You **directly** fuck people up, physically and/or mentally

   - Also, unless they have gone after you personally, being uncomfortable with someone is not direct. Hide them for your safety.
   
   - If someone has directly screwed you up, I suggest telling them what they did wrong before shutting them off so they have a chance to learn from mistakes.
     - An example of this would be one being completely ghosted by a friend even though they did not detect that something was wrong. How are they supposed to know what they did?

- Excessive use of tone tags

   - I'm okay with tone tags if they're needed. Just... Please don't use them in every sentence. It feels like a weird filter.

For those who don't know what this bio is for, it's for [this place.](https://pony.town/)

I really do not suggest getting into that place if you don't know what it is. It's a shit fest.
